# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

The House of Congress Scraper is a tool designed to enhance legislation literacy by providing users with an interactive interface to explore legislative data. It allows users to view and analyze voting records, party distributions, and individual legislator actions in a user-friendly manner.

## Getting Started

To launch and use the application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orionnye/HouseOfCongressScraper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HouseOfCongressScraper
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Usage

- Use the interface to select different legislative files and view detailed voting records.
- Analyze the data through interactive charts and lists to gain insights into legislative processes and party dynamics.

### Additional Features

- Real-time updates: The application fetches the latest data every few seconds to ensure you have the most current information.
- Interactive charts: Visualize voting patterns and party distributions with dynamic pie charts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
